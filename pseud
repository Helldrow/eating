1. Include necessary libraries (iostream, cstdlib, ctime).

2. Define a struct GameWorld:
   - Store the number of rows and columns in the game world.
   - Create a dynamic integer array GameArray to represent the game grid.
   - Define GameElements as an array containing two characters ('*' and '0').
   - Implement a constructor to initialize the game world:
     - Set the number of rows.
     - Initialize the game array and insert the player character ('1') at a random position.
   - Implement functions to initialize the game array, insert the player, generate random numbers,
     move the player left or right, and get the player's current position.
   - Define a function to print the game grid.

3. In the main function:
   - Seed the random number generator with the current time.
   - Create an instance of the GameWorld with 15 rows.
   - Start a game loop:
     - Print the current game state.
     - Prompt the player to input 'A' or 'D' for left or right movement.
     - Handle player input:
       - If 'A' or 'a' is pressed, move the player left.
       - If 'D' or 'd' is pressed, move the player right.
     - Continue the loop until some condition (blnContinue) is met.

4. End the program.
